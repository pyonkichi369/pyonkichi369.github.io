## About Ryokan

"Kyoto Machiya Inn Toshiharu Ryokan"

<img src="/images/toshiharu_ryokan_courtyard.jpg">

It is a Kyomachiya built in 1909 (Meiji 42), and it seems that it was a mansion of a former wealthy person.

Because it was a private residence, there are only 8 rooms, but from each room you can feel the 100-year history of Kyoto.

In addition, the main building and storehouse are designated as national registered tangible cultural properties, and the wall is designated as a historical design building of the city.

Furthermore, it seems that it has been introduced as a "comfortable inn" by the Michelin Guide for several years in a row.

The accommodation fee is Â¥35,000 per room per night, which is a luxurious price for a single person, but I think you will be more than satisfied with the price.

It seems that the name of the former wealthy person was based on "rock", and a splendid lantern is enshrined in the courtyard. It is very beautiful because it is lit up at night.

It seems that celebrities such as Ken Watanabe, movie directors and screenwriters have come among the customers so far.

## About the room

We stayed in the most prestigious room, Kiku-no-ma.

<img src="/images/toshiharu_ryokan_room_0.jpg">

In this room, there is a "zashiki-warashi" who is said to bring good luck to those who see it.

It was very strange that there was a ryokan in the town called Benzaiten, and I felt very grateful.

In this space where the hanging scroll is hung, "margin" is used well, and I felt it was so beautiful that I could sigh.

In addition, there is a "hiroen" in the room, where you can sit on a chair, look out at the courtyard, listen to the sound of water dripping from the Shikai tea, and have an elegant scent of Japanese tea. .

It may be the first time that you have encountered such a relaxing space.

## Food

I stayed with a plan that included dinner and breakfast.

### dinner

The food was really delicious, and I forgot to take a picture of the main course, the sesame pot, for dinnerðŸ¥¹

There are so many, you can eat until you are full! ! !

### breakfast

<img src="/images/toshiharu_ryokan_food_1.jpg">

For breakfast, I was surprised to see a very large bamboo shoot, but the fruit was soft and very easy to eat.

I thought that I could have such a luxury from the morning.

## About the bath

<img src="/images/toshiharu_ryokan_bath.jpg">

The bath was made of cypress leaves, and the relaxing scent spread throughout the room.

In addition, the bathtub was spacious, and the hot water was mellow and permeated my body.

It was a very nice hot water ðŸ˜Œ

## At the end

Looking back now, I feel that I spent a very happy time.

Also, I would like to stay at this ryokan on my next trip to Kyoto.
Good luck and work again ðŸ˜‚
